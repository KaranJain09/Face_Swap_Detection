This project is designed to help users determine whether an image is **fake** or **real** using deep learning techniques. In today's world, the availability of advanced deep learning models has made it easy to create fake images, which can lead to misinformation and security risks. This project provides a simple and effective way to verify the authenticity of an image, helping users stay informed and secure.

## Features
- **Binary Image Classification**: The model predicts whether the image is real or fake.
- **Deep Learning Model**: The project uses advanced deep learning techniques to analyze images and determine their authenticity.
- **Comprehensive Frontend**: Built using **HTML** and **Bootstrap**, the frontend provides a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Django Backend**: The backend is powered by **Django**, which manages the model predictions and renders the results to the user.

## Project Structure
- **HTML & Bootstrap Frontend**: The user interface is built using **HTML** and styled with **Bootstrap** for a responsive, modern design. The entire project runs as a single-page application (SPA).
- **Django Backend**: The backend is implemented with **Django**, handling the logic of loading and processing the model. The HTML file is rendered from the Django `views.py` file.
- **Model Storage**: The machine learning model is saved in the `models/` directory in **.keras** format.

## How It Works
1. **Frontend**: The user uploads an image via the frontend (HTML with Bootstrap) to check if it's real or fake.
2. **Backend**: Once the image is uploaded, Django handles the request and uses the pre-trained deep learning model (stored in `.keras` format) to analyze the image.
3. **Prediction**: The model outputs whether the image is real or fake. This prediction is displayed to the user in the browser.
4. **Running the Project**: After setting up the Django project, running the development server will generate a URL. You can paste this URL into your browser (e.g., Chrome) to view the project and interact with it.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** & **Bootstrap**: For the frontend user interface.
- **Django**: As the backend web framework.
- **Keras**: For the deep learning model used to predict image authenticity.
- **Python**: The programming language used for backend development and model training.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face_Swap_Detection.git
    cd Face_Swap_Detection
    ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. **Open in Browser**: Copy the URL generated by Django (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) and paste it into your browser to interact with the project.

## Project Files
- `templates/`: Contains the **HTML** files for the frontend (rendered by Django).
- `models/`: Contains the pre-trained deep learning model in **.keras** format.
- `views.py`: Django views where the image processing logic is handled and the HTML page is rendered.
- `urls.py`: Django URLs for routing.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for the project.
